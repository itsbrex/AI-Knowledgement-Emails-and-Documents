# Starting points

* Main file is capture.py - no parameters - to loop through and extract tables from pdf
  * capture_text.py extracts for text info
* settings (with comments) are in settings.py
* collate.py - useful util for collating spreadhsheet info

## next

* download files
* work through file (get working)
* debug to understand what each does

## NLTK

* Loop and break into sentences
* senitment on sentences
* keywords in that sentence (comma seprated)
* output:
  * original file
  * start of sentence x characters
  * sentiment
  * key words

## TODO

* see if can get headers (dates or other)
* try search through values (for unamed tables) - see if can get better name
* breaking of column on â‚¬ symbol and try to impose better shape on table
* force breaking of table into x columns
* Refine renaming of sheets (based on samples)
