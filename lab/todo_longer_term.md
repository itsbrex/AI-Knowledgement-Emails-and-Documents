# Improvements - later NTH
* named entities
* Topic analysis
* ?? Misfiled emails
* ?? unanswered emails
* POS tagging (counties but other keywords)
* Postive or negative sentiment
* LEO / County



## NEXT DO
* [later] map topics to emails / areas of interest
* use / demo script and video
* tidy setup docs



## NEEDED DATA
* Power BI Datagrab
* Index Excel data (wdier)
* SEF Data:  By Sector / Mediam / Normal discribution / company as outlier


# HOLD SAMPLE - FOR FUTURE INTERATIONS 
* DA QA - test with questions
* Setup Alert - create but blanck
* Similar companies - list out, 
* OK for now
* Financials - bring through sample	
* Email - update prompt
* Better prompt for generating email
* some sort of graph of key terms
* XL streamlit
* XL indeox - using Eland (find article - C:\Users\pbrowne\projects\local analysis data)
* sample charts?
* embed xl 
* pull in SMART keywords to index
* how to implmenet filter of data https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/elasticsearch

# EXPLORE LOOK AT* Better Search (by Keywords)
* NER on incoming datat
* Better LLM models
* better table info
* being load of more relevant info (find)
* bring in NER and other processing from other project
* Add Public / Private Switch
* Eland - for datascience 
* NLP via eland https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/current/ml-nlp-ner-example.html
